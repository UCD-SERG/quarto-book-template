# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is a Quarto book template that you can use to create your own book.

## About this book

This book is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. You can use Quarto to create books, websites, blogs, presentations, and more from markdown files.

## Getting Started

To use this template:

1. **Update the configuration**: Edit `_quarto.yml` to change the book title, author, repository URL, and chapters.

2. **Add your content**: Create new `.qmd` files for each chapter and add them to the `chapters` list in `_quarto.yml`.

3. **Customize the style**: Modify `styles.css` to change the appearance of your book.

4. **Add references**: Update `references.bib` with your citations.

## Building the book

To render the book locally:

```bash
quarto render
```

To preview the book with live reload:

```bash
quarto preview
```

The rendered output will be in the `docs/` directory, which can be published to GitHub Pages.

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

To enable GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Pages" in the left sidebar
