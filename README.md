## Features

- 🎨 **Customizable themes** supporting light and dark modes
- 🚀 **Automatic deployment** to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions
- 📄 **Multiple output formats** including HTML, PDF, EPUB, and DOCX

## Quick Start

### Using this template

1. Click the "Use this template" button at the top of this repository
2. Name your new repository and create it
3. Clone your new repository to your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
cd YOUR-REPO
```

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) installed. Download it from [quarto.org/docs/get-started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

To verify Quarto is installed:

```bash
quarto --version
```

### Customize your book

1. **Edit `_quarto.yml`** to update:
   - Book title and author
   - Repository URL
   - Chapter list
   - Theme and styling options

2. **Modify `index.qmd`** to create your book's homepage/introduction

3. **Edit or create chapters** (`.qmd` files):
   - Modify `chapter1.qmd` and `chapter2.qmd` as needed
   - Create new chapters and add them to the `chapters` list in `_quarto.yml`

4. **Add references** to `references.bib` in BibTeX format

5. **Customize styling** in `styles.css`

## Building the book

### Local preview

To preview your book with live reload during development:

```bash
quarto preview
```

This will open your book in a web browser and automatically refresh when you make changes.

### Render the book

To render the complete book:

```bash
quarto render
```

The output will be generated in the `docs/` directory.

## Publishing to GitHub Pages

This template includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) that automatically builds and publishes your book to GitHub Pages when you push to the main branch.

### Setup steps:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** in your repository:
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Under "Build and deployment", set Source to "GitHub Actions"

2. **Push to main branch**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial book setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Wait for the workflow** to complete (check the Actions tab)

4. **Access your book** at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO/`

## Writing Content

Quarto uses markdown with extensions. Here are some quick tips:

### Headings

```markdown
# Chapter Title
## Section
### Subsection
```

### Code blocks

````markdown
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
````

### Math equations

```markdown
Inline: $E = mc^2$

Display:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$
```

### Citations

Reference a citation: `@citationkey`

### Cross-references

Reference figures, tables, and sections using labels:

```markdown
See @fig-example for details.
```

For more details, see the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/).

## Customization

### Changing themes

Edit the `format.html.theme` section in `_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
format:
  html:
    theme:
      light: cosmo  # Try: cosmo, flatly, litera, minty, etc.
      dark: darkly  # Try: darkly, cyborg, slate, superhero, etc.
```

### Adding chapters

1. Create a new `.qmd` file (e.g., `chapter3.qmd`)
2. Add it to the `chapters` list in `_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
book:
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - chapter1.qmd
    - chapter2.qmd
    - chapter3.qmd  # Your new chapter
    - references.qmd
```

### Custom CSS

Add your custom styles to `styles.css`. These will override the default theme styles.
